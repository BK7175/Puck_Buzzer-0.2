# Puck_Buzzer-0.2
A advanced new version with Dashboard on with [Bangle.js 2](https://www.espruino.com/Bangle.js2), and [Puck.js](https://www.espruino.com/Puck.js)

# What's new here
1. Leaderboard on Bangle.js

- Tracks who buzzed first
- Displays names in order
- Resets round on button press

2. Sound/Vibration Patterns

- First buzzer: ðŸŽµ Beep twice + long vibration
- Others get short buzz only

# Number of participants
Each Puck.js has a unique name like "QuizBuzzer1", "QuizBuzzer2", etc.
Puck.js sends: { buzz: true, name: "Puck A" }
Bangle.js tracks the order people buzzed in.
(since Banglejs have a limitation here, it connect only 2 puck at a time)

- Problem: 
-Bangle.js (Central) can only connect to one (Fully operational) BLE Peripheral (i.e., Puck.js) at a time.

-It works well with 1â€“2 devices, but simultaneous interactions with 3+ Pucks is unreliable, especially if kids buzz fast.

-BLE scanning + connecting takes ~1s, so tight competition gets clunky.
